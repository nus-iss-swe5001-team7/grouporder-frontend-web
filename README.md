# Group Food Order Platform

## System Design

The application is a single-page web application using `Vue.js`.

<!-- TODO: Considering using the webpack for package, sass for styling and jest for unit testing -->

## Project setup

### Prerequisites

#### Node.js

*Node.js* is used as part of the build system. In order to make it possible to switch between Node versions in the
system, install Node Version Manger for Windows first.

**if you have nodeJS installed in your machine already, you will have to uninstall it, and remove the npm Roaming
folders as well.**

**NVM setup can be found in the Assets section in the release note
in https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases (latest release note is marked with label). File
name is nvm-setup.exe.**

Follow the steps in the readme file => https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#installation\--upgrades

Once NVM is installed follow the following steps:

The currently used version is `LTS v20.11.X`, and you must install this version by running.

* $ nvm install 20.11.0

In order to use the node version 20.11.X make sure to switch to it by using following command in the **command prompt
** :

* $ nvm use 20.11.0

The project uses the *node package manager* (npm) to download tools and packages used for development. NPM version
related to node version should be automatically installed.

* Open *git bash* and check that you have successfully installed *Node.js* and *npm*:

  $npm â€“version

The command should respond with a valid version.
